Each olink ID maps to a gene and this data can be accessed via the CMI-PB database/API:
https://www.cmi-pb.org/docs/api/ table olink_prot_info. This table may be added to these
computable matrices later on. For now the CyTOF harmonized table is using the Uniprot ID's.

OID's can somehow have multiple Uniprot protein ID's. If you look up the uniprot ID's 
Q14213 (OID007797) and P29459 (same OID) you get two different proteins: EBI3 and IL12A,
both of which are interleukins.

2020 day has 454 measured proteins whereas 2021 has 45, once overlapped there are 27
overlapping Uniprot ID's.
